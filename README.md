# README
This repository provides the script to reproduce the work from Daihai et al. 2023

# Notes:
- The code is developed for [linux].
- Running `auto.R` takes several hours to complete.
- Run the file `result.R` to collect and process the running results.
- `Best_ncov.csv` always contains the current best MLL and MLE.
- Run the file `fig3.R` to reproduce the paper's main results.
- You can register to join our zotero group to download the source code of `pomp.orig` R package at: https://www.zotero.org/groups/4832328/lixin_lin
